# Options/Ticker-Analyzer

Old project to test out web scraping (not API).

Originally could scrape unusual option activity from Benzinga and analyze if the activitiy was a correct predition.

Also could grab data on any ticker inputted.

REASON FOR NOT WORKING: Benzinga changed their page layout / source code. 

Kept for code references.
